# PPPPPP - Proper Preparation Prevents Piss-Poor Performance

It has been way too long since my last attempt at a strict ketogenic diet, it's been 9 weeks or so. I have had a few half-hearted attempts in that time, most failing within the same day from me giving in to food cravings. 

### Food addiction is tough!

My problem with sticking to a ketogenic diet is lack of preparation. Without adequate preparation I am doomed to fail and fall back into my carb-laden ways.

Removing carbohydrates from your diet affects people in different ways, for me I find that if I can make it through the first 2-3 days then I am 'over the hump' and ready to thrive eating a ketogenic diet.

To help myself through the first few days I am going to stock up on a simple dish that can be taken from freezer to plate in about 5 minutes. It keeps the carbohydrate wolves at bay for a few hours at least. That dish is Chorizo and Spinach Slice. It is high in protein and has plenty of satiety-inducing fat.  

Paired with a stockpile of eggs, chicken thighs, broccoli, and cauliflower. I am confident I will make it through the somewhat tough introductory phase of weaning carbohydrates from my diet. A meal is no more than 5 minutes away.
